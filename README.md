# 𝗦𝗔𝗠𝗥𝗔𝗔𝗧 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗛 (𝗦𝗫𝗠𝗥𝗫𝗫𝗧)

𝗝𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗿𝗮 𝗚𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗺 (born April 17, 1997), known professionally as **𝗦𝗔𝗠𝗥𝗔𝗔𝗧** (stylized as **𝗦𝗫𝗠𝗥𝗫𝗫𝗧**), is an Indian rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. His music blends experimental hip-hop, cloud rap, and alternative R&B, shaped by distorted textures, stream-of-consciousness lyricism, and unpredictable sound design.

Influenced by artists like *𝘗𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘣𝘰𝘪 𝘊𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘪*, *𝘑𝘗𝘌𝘎𝘔𝘈𝘍𝘐𝘈*, *𝘓𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘪*, and **𝗞𝗮𝗻𝘆𝗲 𝗪𝗲𝘀𝘁**’s *𝘠𝘦𝘦𝘻𝘶𝘀* era, **𝗦𝗫𝗠𝗥𝗫𝗫𝗧** explores the space between glitch-heavy aggression and emotional vulnerability.
